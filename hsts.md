# HTTP Strict Transport Security üîí
## Intro
While checking [Mozilla Observatory](http://observatory.mozilla.org/), you probably should have noticed that there's a painful 20 points deduction if you haven't implemented HTTP Strict Transport Security in your `nginx.conf`. But if you have, you may encounter some issues below like we did.

## But first, what is it exactly?
According to [Mozilla](https://infosec.mozilla.org/guidelines/web_security#http-strict-transport-security):

> HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) is an HTTP header that notifies user agents to only connect to a given site over HTTPS, even if the scheme chosen was HTTP. Browsers that have had HSTS set for a given site will transparently upgrade all requests to HTTPS. HSTS also tells the browser to treat TLS and certificate-related errors more strictly by disabling the ability for users to bypass the error page.

Too abstract? Here's an example in our context that may make the issue clearer to you. Assuming you have HSTS implemented in your Nginx configuration:
1. When you visit `http://g9t9esm2.team:8000` for the first time, you can.
2. Next, go to `http://g9t9esm2.team` and you should be redirected to `https://g9t9esm2.team`, and you'll be given the `Strict-Transport-Security` headers which will be cached by your browser.
3. Now, revisit step 1 and visit `http://g9t9esm2.team:8000` again, you'll be redirected to `https://g9t9esm2.team:8000` (note the `s` in `https`) and your browser will probably report an SSL protocol error.

At this point, if you'd like to visit your unsecured CAT system, you probably have to clear your browser cache or visit `http://g9t9esm2.team:8000` on incognito mode.

This is intended behaviour, according to [this post](https://serverfault.com/a/882331/327653) which cites [IETF RFC 6797](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6797#section-8.3) (an Internet standards document that describes how HSTS should work).

     The UA MUST replace the URI scheme with "https" [RFC2818], and

     if the URI contains an explicit port component of "80", then
     the UA MUST convert the port component to be "443", or

     if the URI contains an explicit port component that is not
     equal to "80", the port component value MUST be preserved;
     otherwise,

     if the URI does not contain an explicit port component, the UA
     MUST NOT add one.

     NOTE:  These steps ensure that the HSTS Policy applies to HTTP
            over any TCP port of an HSTS Host.
