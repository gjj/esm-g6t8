# Why you should monitor your Nginx logs

## AWS IP address ranges are public information

It's documented by Amazon! You can check out [this post](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-ip-ranges-json/) and¬†[this JSON file by Amazon](https://ip-ranges.amazonaws.com/ip-ranges.json)¬†to see for yourself. This also means that anyone can write a bot to iterate through the IP addresses, and try all the common username and password combinations.

Have you tried incrementing/decrementing your assigned AWS IP address to see if you can see anyone else's web server? üòÆ

## Analyse your logs

And this is why you should also monitor your `access.log` files! There are some other really cool monitoring products like [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/datadog-github-student-developer-pack/) (btw, they come free with your [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack/offers) just like the [free domain name](https://is214-esmv2.slack.com/archives/CMVBZ92NR/p1582637039002200)) that you can use to analyse your Nginx logs.

We used [GoAccess](https://goaccess.io) and within a day from our deployment, we saw some interesting stuff.

Do you think these files actually exist on our web server? What's this `HelloThinkPHP` and why is someone attempting to invoke this `call_user_func_array` function? Why are people trying to find if an `eval-stdin.php` file exists on our server?

Well, they don't exist but what do you think would happen if they did? ü§î
