# Why you should monitor your Nginx logs

## AWS IP address ranges are public information

It's documented by Amazon! You can check outÂ [this JSON file by Amazon](https://ip-ranges.amazonaws.com/ip-ranges.json)Â to see for yourself. This also means that anyone can write a bot to iterate through the IP addresses, and try all the common username and password combinations.

P.S. Have you tried incrementing/decrementing your assigned AWS IP address to see if you can see anyone else's web server? ðŸ˜®

## Analyse your logs

And this is why you should also monitor your `access.log` files! There are some other really cool monitoring products like DataDog (btw, they come free with your [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack/offers) just like the free domain name) that you can use to analyse your Nginx logs.

We used GoAccess.io and within one day from our deployment, we saw interesting stuff.

Do you think these files actually exist on our web server? What's this `HelloThinkPHP` and why is someone attempting to invoke this `call_user_func_array` function? Why are people trying to find if an `eval-stdin.php` file exists on our server?

Well, they don't exist but what do you think would happen if they did? ðŸ¤”
